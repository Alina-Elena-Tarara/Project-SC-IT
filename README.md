# Project-SC-IT

This project is designed as a portfolio. It has a lot of HTML, CSS si a little bit less of Javascript. 
This project gave me the opportunity to learn better CSS selectors. 

At his final version, i will certainly upload it to git again. I have still few more ideas to improve the work so far, but, due to my learning pace, i was not able to finish it until this point.
